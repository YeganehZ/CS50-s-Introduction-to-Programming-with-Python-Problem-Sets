'''
In a file called coke.py, implement a program that 
prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, 
each time informing the user of the amount due. 
Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output 
how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that 
the user will only input integers, and ignore any 
integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.

Amount_due=50
while Amount_due !=0:
  print("Amount Due: ", Amount_due) 
  coin=int(input("Insert coin: "))
  if  (coin==25) or (coin==10) or (coin==5):
     Amount_due=Amount_due-coin   

if Amount_due==0:
 print("Change owed: 0")
